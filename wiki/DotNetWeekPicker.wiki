DotNet Week Picker Development Journal

= Update =

I've recently revised the uc_WeekPicker.css to create a much cleaner more generic style
from which new custom styles can be created.

It's a fairly straight forward file to modify and includes support for discrete styling
of month names, the selected week, the current week, the highlighted week and even alternate
row styles to allow additional visual cues for what month a particular week lies in.

= Bug or Feature? =

At the moment selected weeks are not cleared in years that differ to that in which a week is selected. IE: If you select a week in 2007 and then one in 2008 you will see the previously selected week highlighted in 2007 in addition to that of 2008. This effect disappears on post back.
