Dot Net Week Picker is a messy implementation of an elegant week picker design.

The design aims to display the weeks of the year in a simple and easy to understand format that immediately shows which month or months a week would fall into in addition to showing the number of weeks in any given month.

The design was suggested by Rob Farley of Mentalillusion.co.uk as a better alternative to a simple, flat and undefined list of week numbers. It was subsequently and poorly implemented by Philip Howard of Gadgetoid.com.

Unfortunately we can't support the code. But we would like to get it out into the open and, hopefully, polished to a shine by someone who has the time to do so.

I will, however, updated this page from time to time with any changes resulting from natural development and improvement of the code.
